# EvilWordle
A wordle-like game that changes the target word after each guess to be as hard as possible.

## Dependancies
This program uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) as its main graphics engine, but `TextWordle.py` can be run without any additional python packages.

## How to Use
Run `PygameWordle.py`, and exit by hitting the \[x\] button or pressing esc. By default the game will use the Evil Wordle controller.
